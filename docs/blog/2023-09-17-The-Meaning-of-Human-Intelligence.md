In 2020 I wrote a book with two of my good friends and a very early version of GPT3 (still pseudo open source at that time) called Conversations with AI.  That experience shifted my perspective on a fundamental level as to the social impact AI was going to have on humanity in the near future. 

I first came across Kevinâ€™s work in early spring of this year.  At the time I was deeply submerged into the bleeding edge generative AI twitter community.  Things like LangChain, BabyAGI, GPT4 and similar juggernauts were all only weeks old.  [Samantha](http://meetsamantha.ai) stood out to me because it was something that was focused on the intangible human element of conversation and the experience of sharing ideas rather than task completion, productivity, or creative assistance.

Over the subsequent months Kevin and I formed a friendship and have enjoyed bouncing philosophical ideas about his work back and forth.  I was honored when he asked me recently to write something for the site about my perspective on the space and Social AGI.  I initially sent him a long voice note to make sure the content was on the right track for what he wanted me to share.  I attempted to polish the ideas in that voice note into a essay, but ultimately we both felt the initial stream of consciousness with the all the nuance and inflection was the best presentation of ideas.   This is the unfiltered recording I sent to Kevin using a generative D-id avatar.
